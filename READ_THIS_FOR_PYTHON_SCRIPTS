This text file has instructions on how to run the two python scripts found in
this repository.

DOWNLOADING DATA----------------------------------------------------------------

To download all of the data, first make sure you have the scripts downloaded.
Then, when you're in the directory with the scripts, type

`python3 save_chart_as_json.py project_data`

(without the `). This will start the script; nothing else needs to be done for
downloading. Just let your computer sit there and finish up.

VERIFYING DATA------------------------------------------------------------------

To verify the datafile when you're done, you'll need to read the .json file.
However, simply typing `less project_data.json` will present you with unreadable
formatting for the file, making it really quite difficult to discern what is
going on. There's another script in the file, titled "print_json.py", which will
print out the file in a much more readable format.

To run this script, type

`python3 print_json.py project_data`

(without the `). This will run the printing script, which will use some python
modules to print out the verified files to make it more readable. If You
shouldn't need to scan the ENTIRE thing, but you will just need to scan parts of
it to make sure it actually did download all of the data needed.
