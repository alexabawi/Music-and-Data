    "The overarching hypothesis guiding this project is that changes in music mood closely correspond to significant events in American history since 1958. Although it is difficult to quantify exact moods between specific events and songs, it is possible to recognize whether a distinct shift occurs between events and contemporary music of the time. Furthermore, it might also be possible to classify these music moods into general themes. We predict that shifts in general themes of moods will closely follow their event counterparts."

We will use the Billboard API to determine a song's popularity level and the Gracenote API to assign \"moods\" to these different songs. We will then be able to see what the average mood was of songs in the popular charts during specific times. We can then determine if these changes in popular song mood correlate with any major events in society.\n",

(For example, does your data exclude particular populations, or is it likely to reflect particular human biases in a way that could be a problem?) \n",

    "- How will you handle any issues you identify?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the Billboard and Gracenote APIs are publicly available and so far, do not seem to contain any information that could violate policies of personally identifiable information. However, biases may arise from these APIs due to the relatively unknown nature of their own algorithms. For example, it is difficult to figure out exactly how Billboard measures sales and subsequently ranks artists. Also, something such as the mood of a song which the Gracenote API claims to be able to classify, can be a relatively subjective thing to measure. However, as we progress we will take these issues into account, attempt to learn more, and try to adjust our strategy accordingly. "

For example, if we see that mood shifts occur following specific electoral trends then we could predict the same to possibly occur in future events. What we are beginning with is a simple first step that we believe could be expanded on with more time and resources. So even if our hypotheses is wrong about the overall mood, other things like lyrics, artists and genre could be analyzed to test the same thing more accurately and from different perspectives. We will also be investigating how other factors such as digitial downloads and streaming have affected popular music to account for any confounding information."
